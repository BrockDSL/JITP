# JITP Prep



## Phase 1

Goal is to have each PDF file moved into a folder split into multiple PDFs based on individual articles and a screen capture of the screen.

### Steps
1. Pick most recent PDF. (eg. `jitp_v26_2020.pdf`)
2. Create folder that matches name minus PDF part (eg. `jitp_v26_2020`)
3. Move PDF file into new directory
3. Open PDF and use **Print to PDF** but restrict to pages of each article
4. Save article files along patter of `01.pdf` , `02.pdf` etc
5. Take a screen capture of the title page and save it as `cover_26.png` in that same folder
5. Put an `x` in the spreadsheet `progress.csv` in column **B** when issue is complete

## Phase 2

Create back issues in OJS

### Steps

1. Create Issue in OJS, by starting here: https://journals.library.brocku.ca/index.php/jitp/manageIssues#future by clicking 'Create Issue'

3. Add Cover image to **Cover Image**
<img src="new_issue.png" alt="new_issue.png" style="zoom:50%;" />
